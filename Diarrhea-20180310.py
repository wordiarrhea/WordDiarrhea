its interesting that we can only think in words, how fast can you put them together, is there a competition? dont know dont care, it is just a matter of time, just a matter of time that you stop liking it, you need to wait it, i love thos moments, the climatic moments of stoping to like something, it was always like mode, in my mind this rapid diariha of words which tries it self to grasp ameaning or to catch a line of thought but at the end it is only a new error.

Lets execise our sole right, to think, to put this words together to create this endless thread of meaninglessness, there is duality there, a duality in connecting and disconnecting with the world, a duality in experiencing and thinking about experiencing, there is nothing more than that but which one is more connected to the world, heideger would say the first and aristotle would say the second one, what do you thinkk? I think that no matter how far we run, we are not gonna catch it, its an endless paradox to our minds, if there is one and only one thing in the life that we like we should stop thinking about this matter, this is not a question anymore,this is a knife. liberation equals death, the choice is yours. you know what? I am the one who choose how to choose, so I am the one who frames the question, I would choose the third option, getting as close as possible to liberation, without ever ariving at it, to cover half of the distance in each step. thats my manifesto, like davinci and monaliza.

it goes as a wind, this thoughts, hit me, push me over and just pass me without me being able to touch it or hold it dear, this train of thought, I am just a victim of it, under the wheels.

basic colors, red blue, yellow, basicism, you would forget that the hair may not be purple.

physically ill, mentally, beauty comes from sickness, a fragile existance.

it is not about sticking toplan or not, it is not about being persistant or lazy, it is about trying to stay in the train.

not arriving, thats the secret of staying in joy, always in the process.

I geuss the best partner is the one which is (for you) more important to be in your life than to be your partner.

the void.

Resemblance, only happens in human mind.

now you want to make it perfect, you hesitate top let it fly, you check it, revise it to make it perfect, instead of leting it fly awa, seriously? which one is the right one? the perfect structured on which can always be a refrence point or the light and fast one which hits you like a gasp of wind and you would not remember anything of it, except the mere perception that your mind was able to abstract in that second.

When every discussion is finished, and every one is silent, then aimlessness would arise, thats why people feel awkward and try to strat a talk, thats why it is important to feel sombodies silence to understand him.
