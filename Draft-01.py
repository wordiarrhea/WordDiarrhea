        Appraches.
            we should distinguish between "descriptive" accounts of privacy (describing the extent of privacy and protected privates) and "normative" accounts of it (defending its values and extends).
            and we should distinguish between two approaches, one treating privacy as an "interest" the other treating it as a "right".

        History.
            "The concept of privacy has broad historical roots in sociological and anthropological discussions about how extensively it is valued and preserved in various cultures.".

            Aristotle : one of the first notable appearance of the concept of privacy is "Aristotle’s distinction between the public sphere of political activity ,the polis, and the private sphere associated with family and domestic life, the oikos" .
            John Stuart Mill : The public/private distinction is also sometimes taken to refer to the appropriate realm of governmental authority as opposed to the realm reserved for self-regulation, along the lines described by (John Stuart Mill in his essay, On Liberty).
            Locke : Again we have the distinction in (Locke’s discussion of property in his Second Treatise on Government) : "In the state of nature all the world’s bounty is held in common and is in that sense public. But one possesses oneself and one’s own body, and one can also acquire property by mixing one’s labor with it, and in these cases it is one’s private property".
            Margaret Mead and other anthropologists : "the ways various cultures protect privacy through concealment, seclusion or by restricting access to secret ceremonies" (Mead, 1949).
            Alan Westin : surveyed studies of animals : "a desire for privacy is not restricted to humans" Alan Westin (1967).

            there has been a rise in the desccussion regarding privacy in the second half of the twentieth century, which is deeply influeced by the development of privacy protection in law.

            Informational Privacy.
                Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis : More systematic written discussion of the concept of privacy is often said to begin with the famous essay by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis titled "The Right to Privacy" (Warren and Brandeis, 1890). a recognition of "the right to be let alone". Peace of mind : Urging that they were not attempting to protect the items produced, or intellectual property, but rather the peace of mind attained with such protection, they said the right to privacy was based on a principle of “inviolate personality” which was part of a general right of immunity of the person, "the right to one’s personality" (Warren and Brandeis 1890, 195, 215). Officials running for offices : They suggested that limitations of the right could be determined by analogy with the law of slander and libel, and would not prevent publication of information about public officials running for office, for example. Information Control : Warren and Brandeis thus laid the foundation for a concept of privacy that has come to be known as control over information about oneself.
                                
                William Prosser : described the four “rather definite” privacy rights as follows.
                    Intrusion upon a person’s seclusion or solitude, or into his private affairs.
                    Public disclosure of embarrassing private facts about an individual.
                    Publicity placing one in a false light in the public eye.
                    Appropriation of one’s likeness for the advantage of another (Prosser 1960, 389).
                    
                On his view, answers to three main questions were at the time as yet unclear: (i) whether appearance in public implied forfeiture of privacy, (ii) whether facts part of a “public record” could still be private, and (iii) whether a significant lapse of time affected the privacy of revelations.

                Reductionism vs. Coherentism.
                    One way of understanding the growing literature on privacy is to view it as divided into two main categories, which we may call reductionism and coherentism. Reductionists are generally critical of privacy, while coherentists defend the coherent fundamental value of privacy interests.
                    Ferdinand Schoeman (1984):
                        most of the critical views on the concept of privacy, argue that there is nothing morally distinctive about privacy, so : "I shall refer to the position that there is something common to most of the privacy claims as the “coherence thesis.” The position that privacy claims are to be defended morally by principles that are distinctive to privacy I shall label the “distinctiveness thesis."
                        Reductionists: "Theorists who deny both the coherence thesis and the distinctiveness thesis argue that in each category of privacy claims there are diverse values at stake of the sort common to many other social issues and that these values exhaust privacy claims. The thrust of this complex position is that we could do quite well if we eliminated all talk of privacy and simply defended our concerns in terms of standard moral and legal categories" (Schoeman 1984, 5). what is called privacy is reducable to other sorts, such as infliction of emotional distress or property interests. They conclude, then, that there is nothing coherent, distinctive or illuminating about privacy interests.
                    Coherentists : On this view, privacy has value as a coherent and fundamental concept, and most individuals recognize it as a useful concept as well.

        Critiques.
            Thomson : it can be "equally well explained and protected by other interests or rights, most notably rights to property and bodily security" (Thomson, 1975).
                The most famous #Reductionist.
                Ultimately the right to privacy, on Thomson’s view, is merely a cluster of rights. Those rights in the cluster are always overlapped by, and can be fully explained by, property rights or rights to bodily security.
                The right to privacy, on her view, is “derivative” in the sense that there is no need to find what is common in the cluster of privacy rights.
                her critics : (Scanlon, 1975; Inness, 1992).

            Posner : privacy interest are not distinctive because "the personal interests they protect are economically inefficient" (Posner, 1981).
                With respect to information, on Posner’s view privacy should only be protected when access to the information would reduce its value.
                Posner argues that concealment or selective disclosure of information is usually to mislead or manipulate others, or for private economic gain, and thus protection of individual privacy is less defensible than others have thought because it does not maximize wealth. !!! (Crazy)
                In sum, Posner defends organizational or corporate privacy as more important than personal privacy, because the former is likely to enhance the economy.
            Bork : "they are not grounded in any adequate legal doctrine" (Bork, 1990). (this is only about legality in us, not related).
            Feminist Critiques : the special status granted to privacy is "detrimental to women and others because it is used as a shield to dominate and control them, silence them, and cover up abuse" (MacKinnon, 1989). MacKinnon rejects the concept of privacy. Other fiminism theorisians such as Jean Bethke Elshtain (1981, 1995) believ that the rejection of privacy is too extreme. The challenge is to find a way for the state to take very seriously the domestic abuse that used to be allowed in the name of privacy, while also preventing the state from insinuating itself into all the most intimate parts of women’s lives. This means drawing new boundaries for justified state intervention and thus understanding the public/private distinction in new ways. (Anita Allen 1988).

        Defenders.
            "meaningful and valuable concept".
            
            Westin : "describes privacy as the ability to determine for ourselves when, how, and to what extent information about us is communicated to others" (Westin, 1967). #Information
            
            Parent : Privacy and Control over Information : Some define privacy as "control over information about oneself" to defend it (Parent, 1983). He defines privacy as the condition of not having undocumented personal information known or possessed by others. too narrow. "Although Parent’s definition is valuable because he does view privacy as a coherent concept with unique and fundamental value, it is problematic for several reasons. It is too narrow an account because he only allows for a descriptive and not a normative use of the term. As another example, if personal information is part of the public record, even the most insidious snooping to attain it does not constitute a privacy invasion". #Information
            
            Bloustein. Gerstein. Inness : Broader approches define Privacy as a "concept required for human dignity" (Bloustein, 1964) or "crucial for intimacy" (Gerstein, 1978; Inness, 1992). #Dignity
            
            Bloustein : Privacy and Human Dignity : It defines one’s essence as a human being and it includes individual dignity and integrity, personal autonomy and independence. Respect for these values is what grounds and unifies the concept of privacy. Edward J. Bloustein (1964). #Dignity
            
            Fried. Rachels. Gavison. Allen. Moore : On the social level it can be described as "necessary for the development of varied and meaningful interpersonal relationships" (Fried, 1970, Rachels, 1975), or as "the value that accords us the ability to control the access others have to us" (Gavison, 1980; Allen, 1988; Moore, 2003), or as "a set of norms necessary not only to control access but also to enhance personal expression and choice" (Schoeman, 1992). "privacy is valuable because intimacy would be impossible without it" (Fried, 1970; Gerety 1977; Gerstein, 1978; Cohen, 2002). #Social 
            
            Fried: "defines privacy narrowly as control over information about oneself. He extends this definition, however, arguing that privacy has intrinsic value, and is necessarily related to and fundamental for one’s development as an individual with a moral and social personality able to form intimate relationships involving respect, love, friendship and trust". important : "Privacy is valuable because it allows one control over information about oneself, which allows one to maintain varying degrees of intimacy. Indeed, love, friendship and trust are only possible if persons enjoy privacy and accord it to each other". "Privacy allows one the freedom to define one’s relations with others and to define oneself. In this way, privacy is also closely connected with respect and self respect". #Social #Love #Personality
            
            Gerstein : argues as well that privacy is necessary for intimacy, and intimacy in communication and interpersonal relationships is required for us to fully experience our lives. Intimacy without intrusion or observation is required for us to have experiences with spontaneity and without shame Gerstein (1978). #Intimacy #InterpersonalRelationships
            
            Shoeman : endorses these views and stresses that privacy provides a way to control intimate information about oneself and that has many other benefits, not only for relationships with others, but also for the development of one’s personality and inner self. Shoeman (1984). #Information #Personality #InterpersonalRelationships
            
            Rachels : emphasizing not just intimacy but also more generally the importance of developing diverse interpersonal relationships with others. Rachels (1975). "he explicitly criticizes Thomson’s reductionist view, and urges that privacy is a distinctive right. On his view, privacy is necessary to maintain a variety of social relationships, not just intimate ones. Privacy accords us the ability to control who knows what about us and who has access to us, and thereby allows us to vary our behavior with different people so that we may maintain and control our various social relationships, many of which will not be intimate". important : "An intriguing part of Rachels’ analysis of privacy is that it emphasizes ways in which privacy is not merely limited to control over information. Our ability to control both information and access to us allows us to control our relationships with others. Hence privacy is also connected to our behavior and activities". #SocialRelationships #Information #Access #VariousBehavior #BothInformation&Access
            
            Bok : argues that privacy protects us from unwanted access by others — either physical access or personal information or attention. Sissela Bok (1982). #Access
            
            Gavison : defends this more expansive view of privacy in greater detail, arguing that interests in privacy are related to concerns over accessibility to others, that is, what others know about us, the extent to which they have physical access to us, and the extent to which we are the subject of the attention of others. Ruth Gavison (1980). important : "Privacy can be gained in 3 independent but interrelated ways: through secrecy, when no one has information about one, through anonymity, when no one pays attention to one, and through solitude, when no one has physical access to one". Furthermore, the concept is also coherent because of the related functions privacy has, namely "the promotion of liberty, autonomy, selfhood, human relations, and furthering the existence of a free society" (Gavison 1980, 347). #Information #Access #Attention #3ways
            
            Moore : building on the views of Gavison, Allen and others, offers a “control over access” account of privacy. Adam Moore (2003). important : According to Moore, privacy is a culturally and species relative right to a level of control over access to bodies or places and information. #Control #Information #Access #Bodies
            
            Kupfer : Privacy enables control over personal information as well as control over our bodies and personal choices for our concept of self (Kupfer, 1987). #Control #Information #Choice #Bodies #Personality
            
            DeCew : important : "privacy is best understood as a cluster concept covering interests in i) control over information about oneself, ii) control over access to oneself, both physical and mental, and iii) control over one’s ability to make important decisions about family and lifestyle in order to be self expressive and to develop varied relationships" (DeCew, 1997). #3 #Control #Information #Access:Mental/Physical #Choice

        Complications.
            The fact that privacy is an sphere that we want to be provided free from the interferencw of others, would result in a possibility of negative usage of it to "hide domination, degradation, or physical harm to women and others".
            
            Yet it has been difficult for philosophers to provide clear guidelines on the positive side of understanding just what privacy protects and why it is important. There has been consensus that the significance of privacy is almost always justified for the individual interests it protects: personal information, personal spaces, and personal choices, protection of freedom and autonomy in a liberal democratic society. (Allen, 2011; Moore, 2010; Reiman 2004; Roessler, 2005).

        Others.
            Kundra : But one day in 1970 or 1971, with the intent to discredit Prochazka, the police began to broadcast these conversations [with Professor Vaclav Cerny, with whom he liked to drink and talk] as a radio serial. For the police it was an audacious, unprecedented act. And, surprisingly: it nearly succeeded; instantly Prochazka was discredited: because in private, a person says all sorts of things, slurs friends, uses coarse language, acts silly, tells dirty jokes, repeats himself, makes a companion laugh by shocking him with outrageous talk, floats heretical ideas he’d never admit in public, and so forth. Of course, we all act like Prochazka, in private we bad-mouth our friends and use coarse language; that we act different in private than in public is everyone’s most conspicuous experience, it is the very ground of the life of the individual; curiously, this obvious fact remains unconscious, unacknowledged, forever obscured by lyrical dreams of the transparent glass house, it is rarely understood to be the value one must defend beyond all others. Thus only gradually did people realize (though their rage was all the greater) that the real scandal was not Prochazka’s daring talk but the rape of his life; they realized (as if by electric shock) that private and public are two essentially different worlds and that respect for that difference is the indispensable condition, the sine qua non, for a man to live free; that the curtain separating these two worlds is not to be tampered with, and that curtain-rippers are criminals. And because the curtain-rippers were serving a hated regime, they were unanimously held to be particularly contemptible criminals. (Kundera, 1984, 261).

        Conception.
            "Inspired by subsequent developments in U.S. law, a distinction can be made between (1) constitutional (or decisional) privacy and (2) tort (or informational) privacy" (DeCew 1997).

            Informational privacy.
                "Informational privacy in a normative sense refers typically to a non-absolute moral right of persons to have direct or indirect control over access to (1) information about oneself, (2) situations in which others could acquire information about oneself, and (3) technology that can be used to generate, process or disseminate information about oneself."

        BCIBBI.
            <The idea of creating a direct connection between a human brain and a computer has a long history in science fiction. The development of brain computer interfaces (BCI), technologies permitting direct communication between a users brain and an external device, began to become a reality in the 1970s (Vidal, 1973), and have since captured the attention of scientists and the public alike. More recently BCIs have shown promise for therapeutic uses, providing hope for restorative and even enhanced human capacities><I becomes We>.
            <Utilizing both invasive and non-invasive technologies, scientists are now capable of recording and translating activity from populations of neurons to operate external devices (e.g., O''Doherty et al., 2011). In early 2013, the technology took a leap forward as researchers replaced the external computer connection with a second embodied brain, dubbing the approach “brain-to-brain” interfacing (BBI).><I becomes We>.

        Technology.
            BCI.
                <Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), or brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) involve real-time direct connections between the brain and a computer (Kubler, 2009; Wolpaw and Wolpaw, 2011). Bidirectional feedback between the user and the system produces physical changes that can restore some degree of motor or communicative control for individuals with lost limbs, extensive paralysis or who are significantly neurologically compromised (Hochberg et al., 2006, 2012). In these respects, a BCI can enable an individual with severe brain or bodily injury to regain some degree of agency. By providing the subject with the relevant type of feedback, the device may enable her to translate an intention into an action despite the inability to perform voluntary bodily movements. There are two types of feedback with a BCI. The first concerns feedback about the outcome of a self-initiated, BCI-mediated action, such as moving a computer cursor or robotic arm. It provides only indirect feedback about brain activity. The second type concerns direct feedback about the level of brain activity itself. The first is more pertinent to the potential to restore some behavior control in the sense that one can perceive the success or failure of their mental act. Although it is still at an early stage of development, an EEG- or fMRI-based BCI might also enable minimally conscious individuals or those with complete locked-in syndrome to communicate wishes about medical treatment when they are unable to do this verbally or gesturally (Sellers, 2013). These applications of interface technology raise a number of ethical issues (McCullagh et al., 2014), """all the moral questions were bullshit, you should focus on information privacy"""><EIWBCI>.
            BBI.
                Experiments.
                    RatRat. 
                        <Two studies mark the first major advances in BBI technology. In the laboratory of Miguel Nicolelis, Pais-Vieira et al. (2013) successfully transferred sensorimotor information from the brain of one rat into that of another. Rats were trained to complete a discrimination task in which illumination of an LED above one of two levers indicated which lever was rewarded. Rats were then grouped into either the “encoder” or “decoder” cohort and implanted with either recording or stimulating electrodes, respectively, in their primary motor cortices. The goal was to transfer task relevant motor information from encoder to decoder rats via electrical stimulation to investigate whether this transfer could allow the decoder to correctly perform the discrimination task in the absence of any other cues. With each correct decoder response, the encoder received an additional reward resulting in a feedback loop for encoders. Without BBI, decoder performance was at chance; when BBI was used, however, decoder performance was significantly enhanced, enabling animals to choose the correct lever when receiving neural information from encoders.><I becomes We>.
                    HumanRat.
                        <A second group, based in Harvard Medical School, utilized a non-invasive form of BBI to transfer information from human to rat brains, marking the first interspecies brain interfacing study. Yoo et al. (2013) recorded signals from a human scalp and transformed these signals into tail-movement-evoking stimulation delivered to the brain of an anesthetized rat. Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to record neural activity from humans who were presented with a visual stimulus. When the human participant intentionally focused attention on the stimulus, a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), a robust electrophysiological signal corresponding to active visual focus, was produced. The SSVEP triggered a stimulation pulse delivered to an anesthetized rodent''s scalp using focused ultra-sound (FUS), in which focused acoustic energy is delivered non-invasively to a targeted brain region (but see Davis and van Koningsbruggen, 2013 re: “non-invasive”). Delivery of the SSVEP-invoked FUS pulse reliably evoked rodent tail movement.><I becomes We>.
                Future Possibilities & Questions. (elaboration on problem statement).
                    <Similar to any technology that can extract meaningful information from an individual''s brain/body (e.g., fMRI, genetics, EEG), BBI raises concerns of privacy. In contrast with genetic information,"""is it necessary to mention genetics?""" few safeguards have been created to protect neural data. Priorities in mapping the human connectome, as with the new US Brain Initiative and the EU''s Human Brain Project, foreground the potential for brain-based data to be as powerful and identifiable as genetic data. In addition, fMRI technologies are already being used to reconstruct videos observed by participants (Nishimoto et al., 2011), decode the category of objects viewed by participants (Haxby et al., 2001), and decipher whether or not subjects are lying (Davatzikos et al., 2005). BBIs add another dimension to the neural privacy concern; not only is information extracted and decoded from the transmitting brain, it is introduced to a receiving brain, presumably without the ability of that brain to refuse or inhibit the impulse. """need to talk about the difference betwee information and access""" In addition, these transmissions could be communicated discretely, with items such as “epidermal electronics” (Kim et al., 2011)—extremely thin grids of electrical sensors applied directly to the outside of the skin, similar to a temporary tattoo—placed on the forehead under hair, for instance. BBI connections, especially through wireless transmissions, could eventually allow soldiers or police—or criminals—to communicate silently and covertly during operations.><I becomes We>.

                    <Another concern, though still far in the future, is the eventual possibility to use this technology coercively. If thoughts can be planted, or behavior compelled, through interfaces that send stimulation or information directly to the brain, it is theoretically possible at some point that such technology might be used without consent to control the behaviors of prisoners, for example. While the current state of the technology is too primitive for such use now, vigilance is imperative as this research continues.><I becomes We>.

            The concept of distinction in different zones of peoples life has been around for a long time. one of the first notable appearance of the this concept is <Aristotle’s distinction between the public sphere of political activity ,the polis, and the private sphere associated with family and domestic life, the oikos><SEP:Privacy>.

So this is about the boundries that are distincting different areas based on who is controling them.

But one possesses oneself and one’s own body, and one can also acquire property by mixing one’s labor with it, and in these cases it is one’s private property><SEP:Privacy>.

Peace of mind : Urging that they were not attempting to protect the items produced, or intellectual property, but rather the peace of mind attained with such protection, they said the right to privacy was based on a principle of “inviolate personality” which was part of a general right of immunity of the person, "the right to one’s personality" (Warren and Brandeis 1890, 195, 215).

To date there is no legislation regulating informed consent and protecting personal data extracted via BCIs, much less BBIs which the case is more sensitive since """describe privacy of different level""". Further, no formal protocols are in place for how to conduct research using these technologies, with humans or non-human animals. These studies continue to advance; recent unpublished preliminary data by researchers at University of Washington mark the first human to human BBI, utilizing non-invasive EEGs and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Further the non-invasive nature of these technologies, the ease of engineering the relevant hardware, and the enthusiastic DIY culture interested in cognitive enhancement make exploring these ethical issues especially pressing. Ethical discourse around BBI must keep pace with the advances in technology in order to prepare for possible life-changing implications of BBI use. Ethicists and scientists must work together to ensure that the technology is developed with the highest ethical standards.><I becomes We>.
