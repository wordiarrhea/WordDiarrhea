ok, thos is the first time that I am trying this, this fdelas a little bit wwird, but it is fine I geuss, there is nothong special about me, i am just typing something out of my keyboard to this fucking hell, it feels like a little bit wierd, no matter how much I ignore it, but I think that at the end it is better, maybe only becaus we have beemn doing this , maybe only because I am not used to this kind of unreasable connectio , maybe because theis kinf of correspondance and relation is not necessay goo, who knows that, the thing is that there is a kind of twndency in me, in not trying to write the essay, I am way behind myself, I am doing it in the most srupid way posaible, and this is not the sifgn my intelegancenor stubborn ness, ro maybe it is really reffering to both of them... at least thats how I understand it, the subtle flow of words is maintainable, but what is more uniqueis the capacity of leting them go, how is irt possible for you shervin? how can you let irt go. Hpw can free yourself from this really wierd way of doing things, putting all these words together to do what? what do tyou want to prove? nothing, a huge nothingness coming out of my mind, maybe I should put up a blog, like weird blog, like the most weird blog ever in the form of a git hub, handling my word- diarrhea, the amount of incapablity, the amount of nothingness, the amount of useless ness is extra ordinary now, byut the selfesteem is keeping up, I am not loosing any confidence... just letting it out is a really nice feeling that is not easily possible, 

this specific feeling of not beingbeing responsibleness of what yousay and of what you create is amazing, it is just amazing, Rightnow, just right now that I am creating this endless string of letters, I am not seeing what i am typing, I am not

i think that finally i figured this shit out, which i am not happy about and I dont know why
